Depending on the choice the user selects, it will display if the user was _correct_ or *incorrect*:

![alt text](./assets/images/correct.png "Here's a freebie for reading about my quiz!")

At the end of the quiz, the users score will be displayed, along with a text box that will enable the user to enter their initials and record their name to the leader board:

![alt text](./assets/images/initial.png "Enter your initial and earn bragging rights!")

Users can then click on the highscore button in the beginning of the quiz to view their past scores!
